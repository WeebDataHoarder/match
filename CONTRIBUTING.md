# How to contribute to the Match interface project

All development takes place using the [mailing list](https://lists.01.org/mailman/listinfo/match-interface).

## Sending Patches

Patches should be prepared and sent to the mailing list using ```git send-email```.

All Patches must contain a "Signed-off-by" which serves as the Developer's Certificate of Origin.
For more information, please read [this](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches).

## Reviewing Patches

It is expected that all submitted patches are reviewed.

Respond to the email with comments and/or questions inline with the
body of the message.

To indicate that a patch has been reviewed and recommended to be
applied, reply to the email adding an "Acked-by" line.

## Examples

The best examples are those patches which have already been
submitted, reviewed, and applied.  Please check the mailing list archives
and ```git log``` for help.
